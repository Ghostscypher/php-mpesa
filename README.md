## How To Contribute

Git is our version control system of choice and GitHub is our current
repository platform. Here is how we work with Git:

1. Generally we prefer branches over forks to ease internal collaboration.

2. When in doubt, use feature branches and gitflow as your branch
   naming scheme.

3. We have decided to adopt the Git Feature Branch Workflow.

4. Keep your repository clean; delete merged branches and avoid
   committing files specific to your dev environment (e.g. .DS_Store).

5. Follow this guidance about good commit messages.

6. Consider signing commits with a GPG key.

7. Feature branches have the following prefix: feature/.

8. Get your code approved by the project lead before pushing to master
   and deploying to production.
